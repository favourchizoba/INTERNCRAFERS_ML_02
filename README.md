## Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering. By analyzing customer data, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance product offerings.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle,Mall Customers.csv]. It contains customer details including:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Apply K-Means clustering
   - Visualize the results

## Results
The analysis reveals distinct customer segments characterized by various demographic and behavioral factors. Visualizations such as elbow plots and cluster scatter plots illustrate the segmentation effectively.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering provides valuable insights into customer behavior. This approach enables businesses to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
